Task Completed
I have successfully implemented KV caching in the Hugging Face Chat UI. Here's a summary of the changes made:

Updated src/lib/server/generateFromDefaultEndpoint.ts to use KV caching.
Modified src/lib/server/textGeneration/title.ts to include a contextId for KV caching.
Updated src/lib/server/websearch/search/generateQuery.ts to include a contextId for KV caching.
Modified src/lib/server/textGeneration/index.ts to pass the conversation ID to the title generation function.
Updated src/lib/server/websearch/search/search.ts to pass the conversation ID to the query generation function.
These changes allow the chat UI to use KV caching for both title generation and web search query generation, which should improve performance in multi-turn conversations.

To test the implementation, you can run the chat UI and observe the following:

Start a new conversation and check if the title generation is faster for subsequent messages.
Perform web searches within the chat and verify if query generation becomes more efficient in multi-turn interactions.
Monitor the server logs or add debug statements to confirm that the KV cache is being used and updated correctly.
If you encounter any issues or need to make further optimizations, you may need to review the implementation and make adjustments as necessary.
